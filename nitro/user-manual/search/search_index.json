It is able to browse and edit images in both the Apple Photo Library and the File System (i.e., Finder folders on Mac and Files.app folders on iPads and iPhones). All edits are non-destructive. That means that the original image is never modified. Instead, edits are stored as metadata along with the image, and the edited image is reconstructed using the original image as needed. Nitro uses (and extends) Apple\u2019s RAW engine to decode RAW images. Apple's RAW engine supports hundreds of RAW camera formats, as well as DNGs and iPhone ProRAW images. However, there are many cameras that Apple does not support fully. For most of those, Nitro adds additional camera support. These include Compressed Fujifilm images, Nikon HE* format, GoPro RAW and many more. This is one of Nitro\u2019s key advantages over other apps that use Apple's RAW engine.

You can rate images using the number keys from 0 through 5. Those are single keystrokes for ratings. If you want to use the Command key, you can switch that in the app\u2019s Settings panel. Flagging does not have a command key option, since the command key versions would conflict with other standard operations (like Cut, which is Command-X).

That\u2019s because Apple does not provide a straightforward way for apps to get that list. Instead, Nitro has to locate and open a hidden file that contains that information (and the file moves to a new location in almost every OS version). To start with tags, go to the Image menu and pick Set Up Tags\u2026.

XMP is an Adobe-created standard for storing metadata. XMP is a text file format based on XML. There are public areas (called namespaces) that apps can read and write to, which enables sharing of data between apps. There are also private namespaces that apps use to write data that they don\u2019t expect other companies to read or write. Of course, since XMP is just text, other apps could read them, but generally it\u2019s not done.</p> <p>Here is an example of an XMP file with the namespaces, public and private areas delineated.</p> <pre><code>&lt;?xpacket begin=\"\ufeff\" id=\"W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d\"?&gt;\n&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"XMP Core 5.5.0\"&gt;\n   &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"&gt;\n      &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\"\n\n\u2014\u2014 NAMESPACES:\n            xmlns:xmp=\"http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/\"\n            xmlns:nitro=\"http://com.gentlemencoders/xmp/nitro/1.0/\"&gt;\n\n\u2014\u2014 PUBLIC DATA:\n         &lt;xmp:CreatorTool&gt;Nitro&lt;/xmp:CreatorTool&gt;\n         &lt;xmp:Rating&gt;1&lt;/xmp:Rating&gt;\n         &lt;xmp:MetadataDate&gt;2024-06-14T10:55:54-07:00&lt;/xmp:MetadataDate&gt;\n\n\u2014\u2014 PRIVATE DATA:\n         &lt;nitro:Flag&gt;1&lt;/nitro:Flag&gt;\n         &lt;nitro:EditedPixelSize&gt;{5078, 3072}&lt;/nitro:EditedPixelSize&gt;\n         &lt;nitro:OriginalPixelSize&gt;{7952, 5304}&lt;/nitro:OriginalPixelSize&gt;\n\n      &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n   &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n&lt;/x:xmpmeta&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Ratings: Nitro will read and write ratings to the public namespace, which means that ratings you set in Lightroom, or other apps that use XMP, will show up in Nitro (and vice-versa, with some exceptions).</p> <p>Keywords: Nitro will read and write keywords in the public area.</p> <p>Flags: There is no public area for flags, so Nitro reads and writes flags to its private namespace.</p> <p>Edits: There is no public definition of editing parameters, so Nitro also stores its editing information in a private namespace. For brevity, the above XMP file does not show Nitro\u2019s full editing data, but you can open an XMP file to see what that looks like.</p>"},{"location":"#xmp-file-names-and-file-extensions","title":"XMP File Names and File Extensions","text":"<p>This would seem to be a simple topic, but nothing is ever truly simple. There are two parts to a file name - the name itself and the file extension. There are two ways of storing XMP data: in a sidecar and inside the original file itself. Adobe writes XMP to a sidecar for proprietary RAW images - that is, anything but DNGs. For DNGs, and non-RAW files like TIFFs, JPEGs, etc. Adobe writes the XMP directly to the original file. This is handy because the metadata is carried along with the pixel data, but it\u2019s a bit dangerous because of the non-zero risk of file corruption. It also doesn\u2019t work if the image is locked or read-only, or if it\u2019s a movie or other format that does not store XMP.</p> <p>In contrast, Nitro always makes a sidecar file. An option to write to the original file is planned for the future. For proprietary RAW files, the sidecar filename is the same as the original with the file extension changed to \u201c.xmp\u201d. So for DSC0012.ARW, the sidecar will be called DSC0012.xmp. Sidecars are always located next to the original files.</p> <p>However, for other file types, that naming convention is not guaranteed to work because there could be multiple files with the same root file name. The most obvious case is RAW+JPEG, where there is a JPEG original next to the RAW original. Since it\u2019s possible to work with both files independently, if Nitro used the same naming convention, the XMP files would collide. For example, imagine there is a RAW+JPEG pair called DSC1234.NEF and a DSC1234.JPG. Nitro would name the XMP file for both DSC1234.xmp, which would mean changes to the RAW would overwrite the JPEG\u2019s XMP data or vice-versa. To avoid that problem, Nitro adds the suffix to the XMP file name. In this case, the RAW would get DSC1234.xmp, and the JPEG would get DSC1234_jpg.xmp. The same is true of DNG and other formats. The downside is that other apps may be unable to read these files because they are not expecting that file name convention.</p> <p>XMP File extension: The other half of the name problem is the file extension. The file extension Nitro uses for XMP is always lower case, even if the original file name is all upper case. That is done to work better with case-sensitive file systems and Adobe apps. iPhone and iPads always use a case-sensitive file system, which means that DSC1234.xmp and DSC1234.XMP are different files. The Mac usually is case-insensitive, so those two names would be the same file on a Mac (unless you deliberately make a case-sensitive file system in Disk Utility). Windows is also case-insensitive. </p> <p>Adobe apps always use a lower case file extension, so to avoid issues reading and writing data with Adobe apps, Nitro uses the same convention. If it did not do that, then on iOS, you could easily have two XMP files that only differ in the case of their file extensions. However, this is not a perfect solution because not all apps use a lower case extension. Some use uppercase file extensions, and some web services will change the file extension of an XMP file from uppercase to lowercase and vice-versa. It\u2019s something to be aware of on any case-insensitive file system.</p> <p>The important things to know are 1) the XMP file must have a lower case extension for Nitro to read it and if you somehow get an XMP file that is upper case, you will need to rename it to lowercase, which is covered in the next section.</p> <p>Reconnect Sidecars: There is a menu item in Nitro for Mac and iOS which lets you rename sidecar file extensions. It\u2019s called Reconnect Sidecars. The easiest way to get to it is by bringing up the contextual menu in the sidebar as shown here. </p> <p></p> <p>If you pick it, the app will look for all the sidecars and rename them to have a lower-case extension. This is a rarely used feature, but if you find that the app is unexpectedly not processing your sidecars, check the file extension and use this feature to fix them.</p>"},{"location":"#cross-machine-workflows-editing-and-rating","title":"Cross-Machine Workflows: Editing and Rating","text":"<p>Back to top</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Nitro writes edits to XMP files that reside next to the original files.This way, if you need to copy or move the files, the sidecar is easy to include in the operation.</p> <p>What happens if you make rating or editing changes on an external disk and then move it to another computer? What if you edit or rate images stored on a file server or NAS (Network-Attached Storage)? The short answer is that all the data will appear and be usable on the other machine. There are a few details that are worth discussing, though.</p> <p>Here are some steps you can try: Using an external hard disk or file server, add a folder to Nitro on device 1 Apply a rating and edit the image (with a preset or whatever you like) If you are in Edit, exit from that mode. If you are using an external disk, then eject the disk. Go to Device 2 and add the same folder. You will see the rating and the edit badge appear (it may take a while depending on the speed of the connection and the size of the folder). The thumbnail and preview, however, will not be correct. That\u2019s because Nitro does not store the thumbnail or preview JPEG in the XMP file (per convention).</p> <p>To update the thumbnail, do one of the following: On Macs, select the images that need updated thumbnails. Then in the Image menu (or the contextual menu), select Build Thumbnails. On iOS, use the Select button first and then tap the Batch button. Pick Build Thumbnails. Or, go into Edit for these images - Nitro will build the thumbnail when it loads the original image and the editing information from the XMP file.</p> <p></p> <p>If you eject an external drive and open Nitro, then it will alert you about directories that are missing. It is safe to select Remove from App. You will not lose any data. </p> <p></p> <p>This may happen more frequently on iOS because Apple changes the path to the disk each time it is ejected and reconnected.</p>"},{"location":"#non-destructive-editing","title":"Non-Destructive Editing","text":"<p>Back to top</p> <p>This section is taken from the TidBITs article I wrote titled, \"The Ins and Outs of Non-destructive Editing in Photos for Mac and iOS\". You can find it here.</p> <p>One of the near-magical features of Photos, and iPhoto before it, is the way it allows you to edit a photo with the assurance that those edits are non-destructive\u2014you can always revert to the original version. That said, non-destructive editing brings with it some confusion, particularly for those working with RAW images or using Photos extensions to do the editing. Both Photos and Nitro work in similar ways.</p> <p>Most applications directly modify your documents. For example, when you choose Save in Microsoft Word, it saves your changes directly to the document\u2019s file, replacing the previous version of the file in the process. Some image-editing applications also modify image files directly, notably Adobe Photoshop and Apple\u2019s Preview.</p> <p>In contrast, most photo-editing applications work non-destructively and never modify the original photo. The application applies edits to an in-memory copy of the original to produce a real-time preview of the adjusted image.</p> <p></p> <p>The application may automatically save the edit instructions, or it may wait for you to hit Done or choose Save. From your standpoint, the image appears to be modified, but the original file remains untouched. While extremely useful, this non-destructive model can be confusing to users because it clashes with their expectations based on other applications.</p> <p>Photos saves the edit instructions in a location separate from the original file and generates a full-size JPEG (and smaller thumbnail images) that contain the results of the edits. (Photos makes JPEGs for all file types, including RAWs and Apple\u2019s new HEIC files. You cannot rely on the Info pane in the Mac version of Photos to tell you the file type you are editing because it always shows you the file type of the original.) After the edit is completed, this is what is stored on disk:</p> <p></p> <p>The full-size JPEG is an individual file on disk. The smaller thumbnails are stored in \u201ccontainer\u201d files that hold multiple thumbnails at once. The edit instructions are stored in the photo library\u2019s database, along with other information about the image.</p> <p>If you want to continue editing the image at a later date, Photos and Nitro reload both the original and the edit instructions and then combine them to display the adjusted image.</p> <p>Outside of editing mode, Photos and Nitro hide the original photo from view, instead showing the full-size JPEG or smaller thumbnails at every point in the application. While this is clearly correct, hiding the original reinforces the perception that the original has been modified. This is the main point of confusion for people. This can lead to users wanting to copy or duplicate images before they edit them \u2014 so convinced by this sleight of hand, they believe they need to preserve their original before making any adjustments. (Some people duplicate images because they want to have both unadjusted and adjusted copies visible in the grid, or to have two different edited versions, but this is less common.)</p> <p>When working with the File System, Nitro will save edits into an XMP file. When working with the Photo Library, Nitro saves edits and a full size JPEG (or HEIF) into the Photo Library. </p> <p>A key question becomes, what happens if you edit an image in the Photo Library with two editors (for example, both Photos and Nitro)? This is a bit of a problem, because Photos can store the adjustment information for only one editor for any given image. As soon as the changes from a second editor are saved, the edit instructions from the first editor are discarded and cannot be recovered! The original image and the JPEG generated by the first editor are preserved, but the option to make changes with the first editor is lost. This is another key point of confusion for customers.</p> <p>To illustrate this problem, imagine that a user decides to use the Photos Auto Enhance feature on a RAW image and then use the Nitro Photo extension to apply a crop and vignette. This can make sense, because Photos has a good auto enhance and, unlike the Photos Vignette tool, the Nitro Vignette lets you pick the center of the vignette.</p> <p>Step 1: The user clicks the Auto Enhance button and clicks Done. As described earlier, Photos stores a full-size JPEG and the adjustment parameters in the library (the original is present, but hidden):</p> <p></p> <p>Step 2: The user selects Nitro from the Photos extensions menu (or edits using the Nitro standalone app). Here\u2019s where we run into the first difference from the previous example: Photos sends the full-size JPEG (not the original RAW image) to the Photos extension. Photos sends a JPEG rather than the original because the user expects to see the auto-enhanced image in the Photos extension, not the unadjusted original. Since Apple does not publish its internal format for adjustments, nor does it provide access to the code for its adjustments, there is no way for a Photos extension to apply the auto enhance made in Photos. This is also true in reverse\u2014if a user edits an image with a Photos extension (or standalone app), and then edits further in Photos, they are working in Photos with a rendered JPEG\u2014Photos has no way to apply edits made by other companies\u2019 extensions to the original file. Step 3: The user applies Crop and Vignette in Nitro and clicks Save Changes. This is what gets stored in the Photos library:</p> <p></p> <p>Notice that Photos has just discarded its own adjustment data! While everything may look fine, the Photos editing information has been lost, and the user is never informed of this. While the user can go back into the Photos extension and adjust the crop or vignette (or any other adjustment in the extension), they cannot go back a step and fine-tune the sliders in Photos. Further, the user cannot undo the step before they invoked the Photos extension\u2014the only option available is Revert to Original because there is no Apple adjustment data left to revert to. Note that there are also now two JPEGs stored in the library, one from Photos and one from the Nitro Photos extension / Nitro standalone app. This is necessary to maintain some semblance of non-destructive editing. The first JPEG is the one created by Photos as a result of the Auto Enhance step and handed off to the other editor. Remember that for the user to re-edit an image with the same editor, the editor must receive the \u201cstarting image\u201d along with its editing instructions. In this case, the \u201cstarting image\u201d is the JPEG made after Auto Enhance was applied. Though there are two JPEGs, only the final JPEG is visible in the user interface. The auto-enhanced JPEG is hidden; it\u2019s only stored in the library to enable re-editing with the Photos extension. \u201cBut,\u201d you may say, \u201cI can edit in Photos, and then use a Photos extension, and go back to Photos and continue editing.\u201d True, but you are adjusting the JPEG sent back from the Photos extension, not the original adjustments you made in Photos to the RAW file. Imagine that you make the edited image black-and-white. This is what is stored:</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, you are stacking Photos adjustments on top of the Nitro adjustments (and losing the Nitro adjustment data in the process). Also note that this loss of adjustment data will occur if you edit in the Photos extension first and then edit in Photos, or if you don\u2019t edit in Photos at all, but instead do all your editing with two Photos extensions. The order doesn\u2019t matter\u2014just the use of two or more editors on the same image. A RAW-specific note: If you first edit a RAW in Photos and then send the image to Nitro or another RAW-friendly Photos extension like DxO OpticsPro, not only are you working in the Photos extension with an 8-bit JPEG, rather than a 12- or 14-bit RAW, you lose access to the RAW processing features that Nitro or DxO provide. This severe loss of quality happens for any edit done in Photos, even a simple rotate or flip.</p> <p>There is a lot more to discuss in this area, but I will refer you again to the TidBITs article.

The tone adjustment is important for controlling brightness in the image. Tone has a large number of sliders. </p> <p></p> <p>The first slider is Boost. By default, RAW images can look very flat and lack contrast or \u201cpunch.\u201d Boost provides that contrast and punch. Boost is also very important for recovering highlights, and it\u2019s not present in apps from other companies. It controls a key part of Apple's RAW decoder and without control over Boost, highlight recovery is substandard. Boost controls the \u201clook\u201d of the image. The \u201clook\u201d is the mix of contrast, saturation and other sweetening that is applied to a RAW image by default to make it look more appealing. However, in its attempt to make the image look nice, the Boost slider also interferes with highlight recovery, fighting with your attempts to bring down blown-out highlights. You can move the slider yourself, but in Nitro, there's a better way to deal with this problem: use the Recover Highlights Quick Fix (described in detail below). That'll move the Boost slider and other important sliders for you. Note: Boost does not appear for ProRAW images, or non-RAWs like JPEGs and HEIF images, as those file formats do not have the image data necessary to recover highlights. Also, if you want the most control over your RAW images, decrease Boost to 0.5 or shut it off entirely by setting it to 0.0. But if you do that, you will need to do more editing of the image on your own in Nitro.</p> <p>Exposure is a simple slider for adjusting the entire image's brightness. Setting the value to 1.0 makes every pixel twice as bright. At 2.0, every pixel is four times as bright. Moving the slider to -1.0 makes every pixel half as bright. Highlights just work on the brighter pixels, and shadows are for the darker areas. Midtones are right in the center. </p> <p>Blacks, Whites, and Boost Shadows are only available for raw images because they control special settings in Apple's decoder. Boost Shadows adjusts the bottom or \u201cblack\u201d end of the RAW boost curve, allowing you to manipulate the darker parts of the image. The Blacks slider, in particular, is key for dealing with extremely underexposed areas. It sets the \"black point\" of the image, which is the value below which all pixels are black (that is, 0.0). Pixels that are black are not affected by Exposure, so if you have a very dark image, you may want to move the Blacks slider in order to \"lift\" some of the pixels above 0.0, where exposure and other sliders can affect them. The Whites slider works primarily with the brighter parts of the image by modifying the baseline exposure of an image. </p> <p>Recovery: this slider works like a \u201cselective exposure\u201d. Only the brightest pixels are affected, but unlike highlights, it adjusts the brightness just like exposure. Sometimes you will get better results with Recovery and other times Highlights will work better (or a combination).</p>"},{"location":"#clipping-indicators","title":"Clipping Indicators","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>As mentioned above, the histogram includes clipping indicator circles at the top. These circles at the top of the histogram clipping indicators are used to identify very bright and very dark parts of the image. </p> <p></p> <p>If an image has extremely bright pixels, the circles will light up. If you click on the circles, you get an overlay that shows which pixels are too bright or too dark. Another term for this is clipping because the pixel value is too large to be represented on screen and therefore is clipped to the maximum value of white or black. In other words, the pixel is brighter than the brightest value that can be shown on screen. The first circle is the one you will use most often. It'll show you any pixels that are clipped because they're too bright or are black. In this case, a pixel is considered clipped if any of the components (red, green, or blue) are above 1.0, which is the highest value that is normally seen on a screen. Another word for a clipped pixel is a hot pixel, and a black pixel is sometimes called a cold pixel. If you click on the first circle, you see red for pixels that are too bright and blue for pixels that are black. This is also called a hot and cold pixel overlay. An example appears below.</p> <p></p> <p>The other circles are channel-specific clipping indicators, so you can see clipping in just the red, green, or blue channels.

As a result, the histogram does not move as you manipulate the curves.</p> <p>The Curves adjustment consists of four separate curves, one for \u201cRed,\u201d \u201cGreen,\u201d and \u201cBlue\u201d and a \u201cCombined\u201d curve. The red, green, and blue curves only affect one channel of each pixel, while the combined curve affects all three channels.</p> <p></p> <p>You can tap on a curve to add a point, which you can then drag to the position of your choosing. The image updates in real-time to account for the change in the curve. There are limitations on how close points can be to each other, so sometimes the Nitro will prevent you from adding or moving curve points. </p> <p>People often use Curves to adjust contrast. To do that, make an S-shaped curve in the Combined channel as shown in the above image. The more it looks like an \u201cS,\u201d the greater the contrast. </p> <p>At the top of the Curves adjustment are two automatic buttons: Auto Black and White and Auto RGB. Auto Black and White is a good way to make sure your image has good contrast and it inserts multiple points on the gray curve to accomplish that. Auto RGB sets just the black and white points on the red, green, and blue curves, which improves contrast and also corrects color casts in the image. Here is an example image using the Auto RGB control to eliminate the color cast in the image:</p> <p></p> <p>Below the Auto controls are color samplers and a menu with more options. The samplers let you place points on the curve by clicking on portions of the image. The first control sets the black point for the image; the second sets the 50% gray point, and the third control sets the white point. Each of these can cause the image to change appearance. The last sampler is the \u201ctarget\u201d sampler. It places a point on all of the curves at the color value of the pixel you tap on. Except in extreme cases, the target sampler does not affect the image. </p> <p>Like the White Balance sampler, the curves samplers update continuously if you drag on the image while using them. In the following example, a color cast is removed using the black and white samplers. The sampled points are circled.</p> <p></p> <p>Once any point is placed on the curve, you can move it around to adjust the colors similar to the one you sampled.</p> <p>Right below the curve is the black and white point control (see below). This is the simplest way to set the darkest and lightest colors for a given curve.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also add a point manually by clicking on the curve and dragging the point. On the Mac, right-click to get a menu to remove points and make other changes to the curve. On iOS, press and hold on a point to display the menu.</p> <p>In the \"...\" menu are some modes. One mode is Gamma vs. Linear. By default, Curves is in gamma mode. When in Gamma mode, Curves gamma-corrects the data before applying the curve data and then reverses the correction before sending the image data to the next adjustment. Gamma is generally a good default, but if you want maximum control over the bright areas of the image, Linear can be a better bet.</p> <p>The other mode is Equal RGB vs. Luminance. This mode controls the way Curves processes the Combined channel. If it\u2019s set to Equal RGB, then red, green, and blue are affected equally. However, if it is set to Luminance, then the combined curve affects the red, green and blue curves according to the luminance equation, which weights green more heavily, and blue the least. This approach avoids enhancing color casts and is much easier than converting the image to the \u201cLab\u201d color space in Photoshop and manipulating it that way. </p> <p>Here is an example using an image with an S-shaped contrast curve. On the left is the image in Equal RGB mode and on the right, in Luminance mode:</p> <p></p> <p>A unique feature of Nitro's Curves adjustment is an Extended Range Curve. This is enabled for RAW images only. You can engage it by clicking on the \"2\" button at the bottom of the interface, as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>When you view the extended range curve, you are seeing a histogram that ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, rather than the standard 0.0 to 1.0. This allows you to manipulate the extremely bright parts of an image precisely, which is impossible with a regular \"0 to 1\" curve.</p>"},{"location":"#levels","title":"Levels","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>Levels lets you quickly work with the color range of an image.  Most people find Levels to be easier to understand than Curves, but it is less powerful than Curves. </p> <p></p> <p>Start by either checking the box to enable the Levels controls, or by clicking one of the Auto buttons. Levels defaults to working with the gray channel. Gray and RGB refer to the same channel but show the information differently. RGB shows each channel overlaid, while Gray just shows luminance. The Equal RGB button controls the way Levels processes the Gray channel. If it\u2019s set to Equal RGB, then red, green, and blue are affected equally. However, if it is set to Luminance, then the gray curve affects the red, green and blue curves according to the luminance equation, which weights green more heavily, and blue the least. This approach avoids enhancing color casts and is much easier than converting the image to the \u201cLab\u201d color space in Photoshop and manipulating it that way.</p> <p>Like Curves, Levels also includes an Auto Black and Auto RGB feature. Auto Black sets the black and white points on the Gray / RGB channel and will also move the midpoint to add contrast. You can choose the amount of black and white data to be clipped in Preferences. Auto RGB sets the black and white points for the Red, Green, and Blue channels but does not add a contrast point. Auto RGB can correct color casts, when Auto Black is better for general look and contrast issues. In addition, Levels has eye droppers to manually set the black and white points, and you can enter values for the black, mid, and white points. The histogram shows the image before the Levels adjustment. As a result, the histogram does not move as you move the controls in Levels. </p>"},{"location":"#perspective","title":"Perspective","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>Perspective corrects images that are shot off-angle, typically off to the side or up from ground level. The filter works by rotating the image three-dimensionally so that the image data looks like it was shot at the proper angle. By default, the perspective adjustment will attempt to fill the image frame, but that may not be desirable in some situations because it can cut off important parts of the image. In that event, use the Zoom Factor slider to expose the full image without cropping. Once you have done that, you can manually crop the image as you like. When you drag the Vertical or Horizontal sliders, a grid appears to make it easier to line up the image to make it straight. Be careful not to over rotate the image \u2014 if you do, the image may become warped.</p> <p></p> <p>Instead of the sliders, you can select four corners in the image and Nitro will warp the image so that those become the four outermost points on the image. Perspective automatically crops the image. You can decrease that crop by moving the zoom slider, but if you move it too far, you'll get some black areas. You can use the crop tool to remove them.</p>"},{"location":"#raw-tuning","title":"RAW Tuning","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>The RAW Tuning adjustment is at the heart of Nitro, providing unique control over Apple\u2019s RAW Engine. All of the sliders are GPU accelerated and real-time, so adjustments appear as soon as you move a slider. There are a few older cameras that don\u2019t have access to all of the below controls, but most do.  Note: The RAW Processing adjustment only appears if you are adjusting a RAW image.</p> <p></p> <p>Moir\u00e9:  This slider reduces the effect of moir\u00e9. Moir\u00e9 is an artifact of digital sensors which can cause colored stripes to appear in finely detailed areas. Cameras with an anti-aliasing filter tend to have less moir\u00e9, but they also sometimes capture less detail as a result.</p> <p>RAW Sharpen and RAW Contrast:  RAW Sharpen is a subtle form of capture sharpening which works at the Bayer mosaic level. RAW Contrast is a type of local contrast (which can look like sharpening). RAW Contrast generally has a much stronger effect than RAW Sharpen. Both are image-dependent \u2014 the characteristics of the image greatly affect how these sliders operate and affect the default values of those sliders. Sony cameras, in particular, are mostly unaffected by the RAW Sharpen slider.</p> <p>Gamut Mapping: In its final processing step, Apple\u2019s RAW engine ensures colors do not exceed the range of the working color space (Adobe RGB or P3). This is called Gamut Mapping. Colors that are near or outside the limit of that color space are changed to fit within the gamut. Without gamut mapping, colors that exceed the limit of the gamut will be clipped. Gamut Mapping usually provides good results but having control over gamut mapping is helpful in some situations. For example, sometimes you may want the colors to be clipped rather than mapped because you prefer the appearance. Or, you may want to use other filters in Nitro to bring the colors back into gamut.</p>"},{"location":"#depth","title":"Depth","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>The Depth Effect adjustment is available for images shot with the iOS camera in portrait mode.

Lighten brightens the shadow areas while maintaining contrast. Highlights darkens the brightest pixels in the foreground. Stretch Mask controls what the other sliders consider foreground and background. Sliding it to the left makes more of the image \u201cforeground\u201d and sliding to the right makes more of the image \u201cbackground\u201d. So, if you move the slider all the way to the left, the entire image is considered \u201cforeground\u201d and the background sliders have no effect. If you move the slider all the way to the right, then very little of the image will be affected by the foreground sliders, while most will be affected by the background sliders. As you change the mask, the image will change to an overlay showing the mask. Lighter shades of gray denote foreground and darker shades denote background.</p>"},{"location":"#black-and-white","title":"Black and White","text":"<p>Back to Editing</p> <p>Black and White is a monochrome \u201cmixer\u201d which allows you to make black and white images by controlling the percentages of red, green, and blue that contribute to the grayscale image.

The Black &amp; White adjustment comes with some presets that simulate the effect of a color filter placed over a camera lens. </p> <p></p> <p>If you check the box next to \u201cBlack &amp; White,\u201d the adjustment will produce a black and white image using a \u201cluminance\u201d weighting of red, green, and blue. This is generally more pleasing than an equal weighting of the channels, though equal channels is also a preset. A Red filter is good for landscapes and deepens a blue sky. An Orange filter is good for street photography and images with tiles and bricks. A Yellow filter darkens the sky and is generally a good \u201cmiddle ground\u201d choice.

There are two types of lens correction in the app: automatic and manual. The automatic lens correction is provided by Apple's RAW decoder, but is only available for some camera and lens combinations. Apple's system works by reading lens metadata written into the image file (called a Lens Profile). In general, they can correct newer cameras and lenses, rather than older ones. When Apple's decoder can correct a lens, Nitro defaults to using that correction. You can add further devignetting to Apple's correction, though this is not usually necessary. When the decoder cannot correct a lens automatically, the full suite of manual tools is enabled. If you want to turn off Apple's correction, then press the \"Disable Lens Profile\" button, which will enable the distortion sliders. They will also be enabled when an image does not have a lens profile. In that case, Nitro will display \"No Lens Profile Available\".</p> <p></p> <p>The manual correction is better described as \"semi-automatic.\" The best way to correct a lens is to take a number of pictures of a grid with that camera and lens combination at a range of aperture values and focal lengths. Then it is straightforward to correct the distortion and shading. The lens correction is semi-automatic because Nitro will learn how to correct the lens automatically using your manual corrections. In short order, Nitro can correct the lens on its own. The AUTO button at the top can be used to correct the lens automatically once there is sufficient information in Nitro's lens correction database. There are also preferences in the app that controls whether this semi-automatic correction engages without your having to click the Auto Button. That is described in more detail in the Settings section.</p> <p>To learn more about how to correct a lens with Nitro and to build up its correction database, please watch this video (it covers the RAW Power app, but the technique is identical):</p> <p>Lens Correction Video</p> <p>Lens Correction support for Compressed Fujifilm and Nikon HE/HE* images is a relatively recent addition to Nitro.

A few highlights of this support:</p> <ul> <li>Fujifilm Compressed Format</li> <li>Nikon HE and HE* formats</li> <li>GoPro RAW files</li> <li>High resolution modes for Olympus and other camera companies</li> </ul> <p>Some images that are processed through Enhanced RAW Support do not receive automatic lens correction, but many do. Fujifilm Compressed RAW, Nikon HE/HE* and others get lens correction. If your image does not, you will need to use the manual Lens Correction Adjustment, which is described here. The best part about Enhanced RAW Support is that it is transparent to you. Images simply work.</p> <p>RAW images that are not supported by Apple will appear blank in Photos. However, once you edit them in Nitro, then Nitro will create a full-size JPEG (or HEIF) and store that in the Photo Library. After that, you can view the image in Photos. However, if you revert to original (either in Nitro or Photos), the image will be blank again in Photos.</p> <p>When using the Nitro Photo Extension, you can still benefit from Enhanced RAW Support, though the image will look blank in Photos. However, when you open it in the Photo Extension, the image will be decoded and will be editable. Like the Nitro standalone app, when saving the edits, the edited image will be visible in Photos.</p> <p>The camera support list is maintained on the website, and it varies across operating system versions. The latest version can be found here.</p> <p>Another solution to the lack of camera support is to convert images to DNG format. That will preserve lens correction (when possible). There are pros and cons to converting to DNG which are beyond the scope of this document. </p>","text":""},{"location":"#settings-esp-standard-raw-development-and-such","title":"Settings (esp.
