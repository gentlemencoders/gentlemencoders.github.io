						<h3>How does LiveScan handle languages?</h3>
							<p>LiveScan can detect text in 8 languages. You can set the languages to detect and their relative priority in LiveScan's preferences. However, simply telling the app to try all eight languages will usually produce worse results than being specific. 
								This is particularly important for Chinese and accented languages. If you give LiveScan Chinese text, but do not tell it that the text is Chinese,
								it will interpret the Chinese characters as Roman letters and symbols. Or, if you give LiveScan text that has accents, but tell LiveScan just to detect English, 
								then it may ignore the accents.<br><br><b>TIP 1: </b>If you plan to detect Chinese text, then put Chinese first and then, if necessary, English or another Roman language.
								<br><br><b>TIP 2: </b>If you plan to detect a language other than English, like Portuguese, then put it ABOVE English in the list, so that the accents are a high priority.

							<h3>It's hard to detect text with LiveScan for iOS using the camera because the image moves too much. What can I do?</h3>
							<p>Tap the shutter button (the middle one). That will freeze the image and you can zoom in and out to detect the text more easily.</p>

							<h3>I want to switch from a subscription to a Lifetime purchase. How can I do that?</h3>
							<p><ol><li>Go to Manage Subscriptions in the App Store.</li>
									<li>Cancel your subscription to LiveScan. You can continue to use the app until the subscription runs out.</li>
									<li>After your subscription runs out, when you open LiveScan it will prompt you for a purchasing option. Pick the Lifetime purchase.</li></ol>
								This way you maximize the value of your subscription while saving money with the lifetime option.</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>How many devices can I use LiveScan on?</h3>
							<p>Consumers can use LiveScan on any device that has the same App Store account, either Mac or iOS. Businesses need to purchase copies for each employee.</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>I bought the app on iOS. How do I get the Mac version (or vice-versa)?</h3>
							<p>Go to the other App Store, search for LiveScan and download it. When you open LiveScan, pick Restore Purchases to apply your current purchase option to the new app.</p>
							<hr>
							<h3>I bought the app on my iPhone. How do I get it on my iPad (or vice-versa)?</h3>
							<p>Go to the App Store on your iPad, search for LiveScan and download it. When you open LiveScan, pick Restore Purchases to apply your current purchase option to the iPad version.</p>
