                            <p>RAW Power includes support for a very large number of cameras because it uses the RAW
                                engine built into macOS. The list of supported cameras (and any limitations) can be

                                Do you support DNG?<br>
                            </h3>
                            <p>Yes. RAW Power supports DNG, including linear DNG files and iPhone RAW files. However,
                                some DNGs from drones and a few unusual DNGs are not supported as is. To check to see if
                                your DNGs will work, open them in Apple’s Preview application. If they work in Preview,
                                then RAW Power also supports them. If they are not supported, you can use Adobe’s DNG
                                Converter to batch-convert them to a version of DNG supported by RAW Power. You can
                                download DNG Converter at: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/dng_converter_mac/">Adobe

                            <p>RAW Power is not a complete replacement for Aperture. However, as RAW Power evolves, it
                                will meet the needs of more and more Aperture users.</p>

                            <p>The app currently does not have a clone or repair tool. Both are planned for the future.
                                Clone may arrive before Repair, as creating a new Repair algorithm requires some

                            <p>RAW Power 3.0 supports Photos libraries. You can create and delete albums and folders,
                                rename them and rearrange the contents of albums. All edits are stored non-destructively
                                in the Photos library and sync with iCloud Photos. You can even have both Photos and RAW
                                Power running at the same time. Ratings and flags are also available when working with
                                the Photos library and they even sync over iCloud Photos.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>Since RAW Power 3 supports Photos libraries in the standalone app, that is the best
                                choice for most people because of the additional features you get when using the
                                standalone app. However, the extension remains a very good way to extend the Photos
                                editing features. All of the editing features in the standalone app are also present in
                                the extension, but the extension can only work on one image at a time.</p>

                            <h3>Can the app show multiple images at the same time (“n-up”)?</h3>
                            <p>RAW Power does not currently have the ability to show more than one image at a time
                                (other than in the grid view). This is planned for the future.</p>

                                soon. It has an export function instead.</p>

                            <h3>I have the standalone app. How do I get the extension?</h3>
                            <p>The standalone RAW Power and extension are combined into a single application package. If
                                you double-click the app, you have the standalone app. If you go into Photos, edit an
                                image and click the … button you can select the extension. </p>

                                well. There is one main difference: exports are watermarked.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>Because the App Store doesn’t allow trials, the trial is a separate download. If you want
                                to buy the app, you go to the App Store and purchase it there.</p>

                            <p>As an App Store app, these are the licensing rules set by Apple:</p>
                            <p>You can use it on as many of your Mac computers as you like, for personal use. Each
                                computer has to be signed into the same App Store account.</p>
                            <p>For professional, education, or government use, each user should have their own account
                                and individually purchased copy.</p>
                            <p>The iOS and Mac versions are separate purchases.</p>

                            <p>Yes. Apple’s RAW Engine automatically corrects distortion and shading for cameras with
                                fixed lenses (e.g., Sony RX100, Leica Q, etc.). It also corrects many images that have
                                lens profile information stored in the RAW files (e.g, Fuji X-T20). It does not,
                                however, have a general purpose lens correction feature.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>RAW Power is a fully non-destructive editor. In the standalone app, edits are saved to a
                                sidecar file or to the Photos library, depending on how you are using the app. The
                                sidecar file is located in the application’s “sandbox folder,” rather than with the
                                original image. You can then quit RAW Power, reopen the image at a later date, and
                                continue where you left off. When RAW Power runs as a Photos extension, the edits are
                                saved to the Photos library. You can continue where you left off in this case as well,
                                as long as you don’t use another extension (or Photos itself) to edit the image. This is
                                a limitation of the Photos application.</p>

                            <p>RAW Processing only appears for RAW images — not for JPEGs, TIFFs or other image formats.
                            </p>
                            <p>When using the Photos Extension, you may not see the RAW Processing adjustment even if
                                your original is a RAW. That is because the Photos app will send a JPEG to the extension
                                if the image was previously edited in Photos. Edits in Photos include anything in the
                                Edit module, including Auto Enhance, Crop, Rotate, and Filters. To avoid this problem,
                                press the Revert to Original button in Photos before using RAW Power.</p>
                            <p>The Photos Extension will indicate this situation with a yellow triangle in the toolbar
                                as shown below. This triangle does not appear in the standalone application.</p>

                            <p>There are two reasons to use Boost. The first reason is to get the best results for
                                over-exposed images. For those images, decrease the value of Boost to 0.5 or less before
                                using other sliders like Exposure or Recovery. This will allow you to minimize the
                                amount of Exposure or Recovery you need to apply, keeping the image bright. The second
                                reason to use Boost is to get a flatter-looking (more “raw”) image before adding
                                adjustments like Saturation.</p>

                            <p>Those circles light up whenever there is pixel data being clipped in that channel
                                (brighter than can be displayed). There are indicators for red, green, and blue. If you
                                click on any of the red, green, and blue circles, it engages the “hot pixels” feature
                                for that channel only. Clicking on the gray circle shows hot and cold pixels, where red
                                means a pixel is clipped in red, green, or blue, and where blue means a pixel is black
                                (0.0 in all three channels).</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>RAW Sharpen (found in the RAW Fine Tuning adjustment) is a subtle sharpener that works as
                                part of the RAW decoding itself. The Sharpen adjustment is a luminance-oriented
                                sharpener that runs after decoding, but still operates on the linear data found in RAW
                                files.</p>

                                What do the Linear / Gamma and Luminance / Equal RGB controls in Curves do?<br>
                            </h3>
                            <p>The label of the buttons indicates the current state of the control, so if you see
                                “Linear”, then Curves is operating in a Linear mode, but if you see Gamma, then Curves
                                is processing in a gamma-corrected mode. This is also true for the Luminance / Equal RGB
                                button.</p>
                            <p>RAW Power works with floating point, linear pixel data. If you choose Linear for Curves,
                                then Curves will manipulate the linear pixel data as is. If you choose Gamma, then
                                Curves will gamma-correct the pixels, apply the curve, and then undo the
                                gamma-correction (so the pixel data is converted back into linear values).</p>
                            <p>Equal RGB means that the Combined curve will apply changes to the Red, Green, and Blue
                                components of each pixel equally. This will affect any tint the image has. However, if
                                you choose Luminance, then the Combined curve will modify the luminance value of each
                                pixel, and will not affect the tint.</p>
