                <p>Nitro and RAW Power uses two technologies to support cameras. Most cameras are supported by Apple directly, and Apple periodically releases support for new cameras. However, support has been slow in recent years. Because of this (on macOS Big Sur, iOS 14, and later), 
                    Nitro and RAW Power have their own Extended RAW support which provides the same quality decoder and editing features. This is a unique feature of these apps.</p>
                <p><u><a href="https://www.gentlemencoders.com/extended-raw/index.html">Here is the current list of supported cameras.</a></u></p>
        <p>Any exceptions are footnoted on those pages. </p>
        <p>For Extended RAW, Nitro supports non-standard aspect ratios, crop and sports modes. However, RAW Power does not.</p>
