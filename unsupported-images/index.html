                <p>RAW Power relies on Apple’s RAW engine for camera support. Apple periodically releases support for new cameras, but it does not pre-announce that support. As a result, unfortunately, we do not have any insight into WHEN Apple will support a new camera.</p>
        <p>Apple publishes (and updates) web pages for camera support. On macOS Big Sur and iOS 14, RAW Power has extended RAW Support. <u><a href="https://www.gentlemencoders.com/extended-raw/index.html">Here is the current list.</a></u></p>
        <p>Any exceptions are footnoted on those pages. </p>
        <p>Camera support is delivered both in software updates (like iOS 13.3) and in the background as “Mobile Updates”. Apple does not provide a user interface for controlling or downloading Mobile Updates.</p>
        <p>If your camera is supported according to the above lists, but you still cannot get it to work, please try the following:</p>
        <p>– make sure you have all updates of macOS or iOS installed<br>
        – plug your device into power<br>
        – make sure it is connected to WiFi<br>
        – restart your device<br>
        – check again the next day.</p>
        <p>I wish I had a better series of troubleshooting steps, but these appear to work pretty reliably. If you have additional questions, you can <u><a href="https://support.gentlemencoders.com/contact-us/">contact me</a></u>.</p>
