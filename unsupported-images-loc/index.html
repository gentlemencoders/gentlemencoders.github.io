                <p>RAW Power uses two technologies to support RAW images. Most are supported by Apple directly. Apple periodically releases support for new cameras, but it does not pre-announce that support. For other cameras (on macOS Big Sur, iOS 14, and later), 
                    RAW Power has its own Extended RAW support which provides the same quality decoder and editing features. This is a unique feature of RAW Power.</p>
                <p><u><a href="https://www.gentlemencoders.com/extended-raw/index.html">Here is the current list of supported cameras.</a></u></p>
        <p>Any exceptions are footnoted on those pages. </p>
        <p>For Extended RAW Support, there are some exceptions. Specifically, images shot with non-standard aspect ratios (like 16:9), or Sports Mode (which makes a cropped image) are not supported by RAW Power.</p>
